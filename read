testing
I FEEL SO DUMB, MY HEAD DOESNT WANT TO CONSUME ANYTHING
HOW DO I APPROACH this

I REALLY NEED TO GRASP THESE CONCEPTS
1. deep angular techniques
2. angular testing
3. deployment

The @HostListener decorator lets you subscribe to events of the DOM element that hosts an attribute directive, the <p> in this case.













testing
1.SERVICES
=> USING HttpClientTestingModule, HttpTestingController
=> USE TESTBED TO CREATE THE httpmock and the service in the beforeEach
=> using httpmock to create a request object that returns the mock data.




2. COMPONENTS
=> testing nativeElements using debugElement

3. ROUTING
=> USE RouterTestingModule.withRoutes([])
=> USE component fixtures
	A fixture is a wrapper for a component and itâ€™s template.
  We create an instance of a component fixture through the TestBedtor.
